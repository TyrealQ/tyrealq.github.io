collection: talks
excerpt: Introduce [NLP 101](https://youtu.be/waUZ_Khn7ZY) where we explore the fundamentals of natural language processing (NLP) by performing sentiment analysis—a powerful tool to analyze public opinion and emotion in text data. This step-by-step tutorial will show you how to apply both advanced pretrained models from Hugging Face’s Transformers library and the lexicon-based VADER approach. Using a practical dataset of college football stadium reviews, we'll evaluate and compare these methods using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Designed for all experience levels, this video aims to make AI approachable, useful, and impactful for sport management professionals and researchers alike.

[NLP 101](https://youtu.be/waUZ_Khn7ZY) is a step-by-step tutorial that introduces the fundamentals of NLP by performing sentiment analysis—a powerful tool to analyze public opinion and emotion in text data. I’ll walk you through how to use pretrained models from Hugging Face’s Transformers library and compare them to a straightforward lexicon-based approach using VADER. We’ll work with a unique dataset of college football stadium reviews drawn from one of my earlier research projects, discussing critical performance metrics—accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score—to ensure we evaluate these methods effectively.
