excerpt: 'Drawing on LLMs (transfer learning), we analyzed Tripadvisor reviews to identify the key drivers of exceptional college football game day experience. The findings revealed that top-rated experiences stem from a combination of engaging game dynamics, quality facilities, emotional atmosphere, and fan community. Critical to achieving high satisfaction is the effective management of facility maintenance and safety protocols. Our study provides event managers with both a comprehensive framework for understanding the fan experience and practical tools to enhance game day operations, bridging theoretical insights with actionable strategies.'

This study pioneers a transfer learning approach grounded in a post-positivism paradigm, underpinned by an integrative customer experience framework for aspect-based sentiment analysis of user-generated content, shedding light on the complexity of the college football game day experience. Three fine-tuned large language models were employed to qualitatively identify and quantitatively analyze customer experience from Tripadvisor reviews on college football stadiums. Our findings indicated that fansâ€™ positive reactions to stimuli related to core (game dynamics), functional (facilities/services), emotional (intense feelings), and socialization (fan interactions/bonding) significantly increased the likelihood of them giving a five-star rating. Mitigating negative experiences across functional, emotional, socialization, safety, and monetary experience was crucial for achieving a top rating, with reducing negative functional issues and safety concerns having the greatest positive impact. Our study contributes to the sport management literature by establishing a unified view of customer experience, enabling a holistic conceptualization and operationalization of customer experience in spectator sports. Empirically, our research proposes targeted strategies to manage customer experience in college football and offers sport management professionals ready-to-use large language models along with detailed deployment guidelines tailored for distinct use cases.
