excerpt: 'Our research examined how gamification impacts viewer engagement in esports livestreaming through an online survey. The findings revealed that immersion and socialization features significantly enhanced viewer engagement, with distinct gender preferences: females responded more strongly to immersive elements, while males were more influenced by social features. These insights provide platforms with clear direction for optimizing their gamification strategies to enhance viewer experiences across different audience segments.'

The current study examined the relationships between gamification, perceived value, and viewer engagement in a gamified livestreaming service, where gamification complemented the viewing of an esports event. Data from 458 viewers on a livestreaming platform were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results showed that immersion and socialization gamification enhanced the event’s perceived value and viewer engagement, while the effects of achievement gamification were weak and not significant. Moreover, we identified gendered differences as to engagement enhancement in esports livestreams. Immersion gamification and functional value of the event were more influential among females, whereas socialization gamification and social value were more impactful among males. Theoretical and practical implications that can help researchers and practitioners better understand, design, and operate gamification are discussed.
