Welcome! I'm Ty, also known as Dr. Q, an [Assistant Professor of Sport Management at Louisiana State University](https://www.lsu.edu/chse/kinesiology/faculty_listing/qian.php). Outside of work, I enjoy video games and cherish a joyful life with my wife, Tracy. We share our passions, celebrate special moments, and find meaning in the beauty of everyday life.

That said, please sit back, relax, and enjoy Ty's British Hello.

## Research Interests

My research bridges service marketing and digital communication through a post-positivist lens, examining consumer experiences and interactions across both traditional and digital channels, with particular focus on sports and esports environments. Through artificial intelligence (AI)—particularly natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV)—I analyze unstructured data from these diverse channels to advance our understanding of modern service ecosystems and digital transformation.

## Open Resource Space

I manage knowledge spaces in the following areas:

- Sport Management Research: Generating insights into consumer psychology and behavior in sports and esports contexts, such as the impact of gamification on social live streaming and the dynamics of user-generated content (UGC), while also developing accessible teaching frameworks that translate research into inclusive learning experiences and help democratize knowledge across diverse communities.
- NLP Applications: Integration of large language models (LLMs) with aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), BERTopic topic modeling, and word embedding techniques.
- Computer vision: Application of large multimodal models (LMMs) for computer vision tasks and advanced video analytics.
- Datasets: Custom-curated collections of multimodal data, encompassing user-generated content (UGC), news media, corporate reports, and other textual, visual, and audiovisual sources.
