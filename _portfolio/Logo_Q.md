Brand logos for Yizhou (Tyreal) Qian, created via [Ideogram](https://ideogram.ai/) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

Originally from mainland China, I carry a cultural heritage embedded in my name 钱亦舟 (Qian Yi Zhou). The surname Qian (钱) traces back to the State of Qian in ancient China and holds historical significance in its connection to currency and wealth, as this character represents money in Chinese. In my given name, 亦舟 (Yi Zhou), each character adds meaningful depth - 亦 (Yi) means "also" or "alike," while 舟 (Zhou) means "boat" or "vessel." Together, my name conveys a profound truth: like vessels navigating the vast sea, we are all on a shared journey across life's boundless waters.

The logo design captures this heritage through thoughtful symbolism. The boat silhouette, derived from the character 舟 in my name, forms an integral part of the letter Q, creating a harmonious blend of Eastern and Western elements. The circular enclosure represents unity and completion, while "Dr." anchors my professional identity. This minimalist design elegantly merges my Chinese heritage with contemporary aesthetics, creating a timeless symbol that works effectively across various applications.
