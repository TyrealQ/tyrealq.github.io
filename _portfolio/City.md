3D City Landmark, created using Nano Banana Pro

## Prompt
A clear 45-degree top-down view presents a 3D chibi-style miniature of a city landmark. The image is landscape (16:9) with a centered layout, placing the building at the midpoint of the frame to highlight the precise, detailed, three-dimensional qualities of the miniature model. Materials appear smooth and refined, with authentic PBR texture and soft, realistic lighting and shadow.

The composition is clean, minimal, and visually consistent. Weather elements are integrated into the city architecture, and dynamic weather effects interact with the scene to create an immersive atmospheric experience.

The text should match the language of the input city name. The background uses a solid, soft tone that emphasizes the subject and keeps the style fresh and comfortable. At the top of the image, display a prominent weather icon; below the icon, show the date (very small text) and temperature range (medium text); above the icon, display the city name (large text). The weather information has no background and can overlap with the architecture.
Retrieve the current weather for the input city before generating.

City name: **CITY NAME**
